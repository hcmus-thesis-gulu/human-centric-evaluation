	"description": "Thank you for taking the time to participate in our survey. This survey is an integral part of our thesis project evaluation process, and your valuable input will contribute significantly to our research. In this survey, you will be presented with various sets of videos, each serving a different purpose in our evaluation.\n\nThere are three types of video sets that will be randomly shown to you:\n    - Original video: These videos have not been shortened or modified in any way.\n    - Summary video: This type of video set includes two subtypes:\n        a. User summary: These summaries have been provided by users as part of our dataset. They represent human-generated summaries.\n        b. Machine-generated summary: These summaries have been extracted using an automated mechanism, such as our proposed method.\n    - A pair of videos: In this case, you will be shown a pair consisting of one original video and one summary video. You will be informed which video is the original and which one is the summary.\n\nAlong with each video set, you will be presented with different types of questions. We kindly request that you answer these questions as genuinely as possible to ensure accurate results.\n\nYour participation is vital to the success of our thesis project, and we genuinely appreciate your contribution. If you have any questions or concerns during the survey, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.\n\nThank you once again for your help.",
